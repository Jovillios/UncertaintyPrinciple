## Uncertainty Principle for the Fourier Transform

The uncertainty principle for the Fourier transform states that the product of the standard deviation of a function and the standard deviation of its Fourier transform cannot be smaller than a certain constant. This constant is equal to 1/4π. The standard deviation of a function is a measure of its spread. The standard deviation of a function f(x) is given by the square root of the integral of the square of the function multiplied by the square of the distance from the mean value of the function. The standard deviation of the Fourier transform of f(x) is given by the square root of the integral of the square of the Fourier transform of f(x) multiplied by the square of the distance from the mean value of the Fourier transform of f(x). The uncertainty principle for the Fourier transform is given by the equation:

σxσk ≥ 1/4π

where σx is the standard deviation of the function f(x) and σk is the standard deviation of the Fourier transform of f(x).
